**OUR MISSION**

We are childhood friends, age group teammates, and Olympic team members and water polo has and always will be a part of who we are. Growing up, water polo gear was hard to come by so we came up with the idea of making it more accessible, and KAP7 was born. Our mission is to positively impact the development of the sport by growing the community worldwide, creating best in class events and educational programs, and providing the highest quality water polo gear on the market.

We want to thank you for your support and trust in KAP7, we couldn’t have done it without you; the water polo community. Because water polo means so much to us, we created a program where we give back a portion of every sale to the sport.
