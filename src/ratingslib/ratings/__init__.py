"""
Python package for Rating methods
This package includes the implementation of the following rating methods:

 #. WinLoss : :mod:`.winloss`
 #. Colley : :mod:`.colley`
 #. Massey : :mod:`.massey`
 #. Elo : :mod:`.elo`
 #. Keener : :mod:`.keener`
 #. OffenseDefense : :mod:`.od`
 #. AccuRATE : :mod:`.accurate`
 #. GeM : :mod:`.markov`

Several evaluation metrics that related with rating methods are included in
the module metrics.py.

All rating systems in this package have been implemented by exploiting
several functions of NumPy and SciPy libraries in python that
are intended for algebraic and scientific computations.
Particularly, NumPy was used:

 #.	matrices and vectors handling
 #.	linear systems solving
 #.	finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors
 #.	other problems of linear algebra required for the implementation of rating methods

As for the statistical tests, such as Kendallsâ€™s Tau for the correlation of
ranking lists, SciPy was used.
